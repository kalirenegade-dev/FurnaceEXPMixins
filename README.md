Minecraft Furnace Experience Storage Mod
This mod enables players to accumulate experience points (exp) inside a regular Minecraft furnace, allowing extraction of items via a hopper without losing any exp. It provides two methods to retrieve exp from the furnace:

1. Breaking the Furnace: Breaking the furnace causes it to drop the accumulated exp.

2. Extracting a Smelted Item: Taking a smelted item out of the furnace reclaims all the accumulated exp.

This mod operates server-side, eliminating the need for clients to download additional content. Originally developed for RLCraft, it is compatible with any Forge 1.12.2 server.

Note for SpongeForge with RLCraft: There's a known issue when using this mod with SpongeForge and RLCraft. Specifically, the MultiMine-1.12.2 mod may interfere, preventing furnaces from dropping exp when mined. To resolve this, remove the MultiMine-1.12.2 mod. This issue seems to occur only with servers running MultiMine-1.12.2 and spongeforge-1.12.2-2838-7.4.7.

Compatibility:

Minecraft Version: 1.12.2
Forge Version: Compatible with any Forge 1.12.2 server
SpongeForge: Note the issue with MultiMine-1.12.2 as described above.
